### > [中文文档](./README.md)

It is used to conveniently view the origina log generated by the debug library [ZXKitLogger](https://github.com/DamonHu/ZXKitLogger) on the iOS mobile.

[ZXKitLogger](https://github.com/DamonHu/ZXKitLogger) uses `SQLite` to store log information. If you use a general SQLite viewing tool, it is just a table one by one, and some are charged. Therefore, the development of this tool is convenient for viewing data with `ZXKitLogger` more intuitively.

## Client Downloads

[Releases](https://github.com/DamonHu/ZXKitLogger_Mac/releases), download the `dmg` file in `Release` and drag it into the application

## local log

Drag the `.db` file generated by `ZXKitLogger`, or the `.log` file exported by sharing, directly into the left menu bar, and it can be automatically parsed and displayed in color according to the log type, and can be searched and filtered.

## remote log

Remote log refers to the real-time log function of the local area network that the client has connected to `ZXKitLogger`. [ZXKitLogger LAN real-time log](https://github.com/DamonHu/ZXKitLogger#%E5%85%AD%E5%B1%80%E5%9F%9F%E7%BD%91%E5%AE%9E% E6%97%B6%E6%97%A5%E5%BF%97), you can use this tool to view the logs of devices under the same LAN.

## client configuration

If the mobile client modifies the values ​​of `socketPort`, `socketDomain`, `socketType`, or the decrypted `privacyLogPassword`, `privacyLogIv`, then please modify it to the corresponding value in the settings of the MAC client, and keep the two ends consistent. Otherwise, it will cause connection or decryption errors

## Development progress
