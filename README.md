This client is designed for conveniently viewing log data generated by the iOS-side debugging log library [DDLoggerSwift](https://github.com/DamonHu/DDLoggerSwift).  

[DDLoggerSwift](https://github.com/DamonHu/DDLoggerSwift) stores log information in SQLite. Using generic SQLite viewing tools only displays logs as plain rows, and some tools are even paid. Therefore, this tool was developed to provide a more intuitive way to view and analyze the data.  

## Client Download  

Download the `dmg` file from [Releases](https://github.com/DamonHu/DDLoggerClient/releases) and drag it into the Applications folder.  

## Viewing Logs  

Drag the `.db` file generated by `DDLoggerSwift` or the `.log` file exported via sharing into the left sidebar. The logs will be automatically parsed and displayed with colors based on their type. You can also perform search and filtering operations.  

## Client Configuration  

If the mobile client modifies the values of `privacyLogPassword` or `privacyLogIv` for decryption, please update the corresponding values in the MAC client settings to ensure consistency between both ends. Otherwise, connection or decryption errors may occur.
